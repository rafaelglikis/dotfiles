# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** - tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

## Statuses

The skills speak in terms of six canonical statuses. This table maps those statuses to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Status             | Tracker label        | Meaning                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `needs-review`     | `needs-review`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`       | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`  | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`  | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`          | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |
| `done`             | `done`               | Implementation is complete               |

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

Input/reference:

$ARGUMENTS

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) - vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges** - the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change - rename a column, retype a shared symbol - whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand-contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket - green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work
- **Status**: the tracker label mapped from the ticket's canonical status

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct - does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Save the tickets locally

Infer a short, descriptive kebab-case feature slug from the conversation or existing `.scratch` artifacts. If it cannot be inferred confidently, ask the user for the feature slug and wait for their answer.

Write one file per approved ticket under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/tickets/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order (blockers first). Put the ticket's ID, title, status, and blocker IDs in YAML frontmatter. Quote IDs so YAML preserves leading zeroes, and use an empty list when there are no blockers. Assign `ready-for-agent` unless the ticket genuinely requires human implementation, in which case assign `ready-for-human`; use the mapped tracker string from the Statuses table. Use the per-ticket file template below - one ticket per file, never a single combined file.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

<local-ticket-template>

---
id: "<NN>"
title: <Ticket title>
status: <initial status>
blocked-by: []
---

# <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective - not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2

</local-ticket-template>

In each ticket, avoid specific file paths or code snippets - they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts - not a working demo, just the important bits.

After saving the tickets, tell the user to clear context between tickets and invoke the `implement` skill for one frontier ticket at a time (`/implement <ticket-path>` in Claude).
